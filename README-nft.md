## Overview NFT-Preview-Card

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements


### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned a lot about flexbox,positions,how to add a icon on the browser tab and that is important to write the stylesheet link in your html...otherwise the css doesn´t work. :-)
An di learned how to create a repo on Github.

### Continued development

I want to become more confident with flexbox and i want to start learning grid and responsive design.
